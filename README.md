## Overview
This project is a simple Machine Learning GUI application built with Taipy and TensorFlow. It allows users to classify images using a trained neural network model through a graphical interface.

## Features
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly interface created with Taipy.
- **Image Classification**: Classifies images based on a pre-trained TensorFlow model.
- **Demo Images**: Includes a set of demo images for testing.
- **Model Handling**: Easily load and use the trained model.
